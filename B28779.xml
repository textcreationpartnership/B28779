            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> THat the Clothiers in general of the Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Counties of <hi>England</hi> will thereby be prevented of keeping their constant Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets at <hi>Blackwell-Hall,</hi> and many other Markets confin'd to a certain time; and also it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prejudicial to the <hi>Norwich</hi> Traders if they cannot bring their Goods to <hi>London</hi> Weekly, there being such great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the Fashion of their Stuffs, that it will be a great discouragement to their Manufacture, it being impossible for them to Travel the Roads by reason they will be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all Officers to stop them and make them unload their Wagons in every Parish they go through.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Reason is, That when their Wagons are unloaded their Loading is then known what it is, which may endanger them to be robb'd, for they do not take up all their Goods at one Town or Place, but at several places on the Road, so that it is impossible they can give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true Bill of Loading to be just, and if they are oblig'd to an Oath they must forswear themselves, by reason they cannot have Weights at every Place where they take up their Loading.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis very probable the Officers will not believe them without an Oath, and Highway-men may pretend themselves Officers, and force them to unload their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and when they see what they have, may take that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Robbing the Carrier.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Honours Favour is humbly begged in their behalf, to consider their Condition as to Your great Wisdom shall seem meet.</hi>
